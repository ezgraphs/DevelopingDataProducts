An ETF (exchange traded fund), is a marketable security like a mutual fund. It tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or other basket of assets. This application allows you to explore the recent value for up to 4 funds if you had invested in 2008. Enter the number of shares for each fund, and the chart will be updated with the aggregate performance of all funds. 

In addition, the value of the particular fund at the beginning and end of the time period will be displayed to the right of the number of shares selected.In addition, a checkbox may be checked to include Bollinger Bands - a indicator plotted two standard deviations away from the moving average. These bands are used as an indicator of volatility by technical traders.
